# Diwali_Sales_Analysis_EDA
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on leveraging Diwali sales data to enhance customer experience and boost revenue. By utilizing the power of Python's data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I have gained valuable insights into the sales trends and patterns.

Key Objectives

->I performed in-depth analysis on Diwali sales data to uncover hidden patterns, customer preferences, and market trends. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), aimed to gain a better understanding of how sales were impacted during the festive season.

->Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas to ensure accurate analysis.

->Utilized NumPy for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.

->Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present sales trends.

->Explored correlations between different variables to uncover patterns in sales data.

->Conducted statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
